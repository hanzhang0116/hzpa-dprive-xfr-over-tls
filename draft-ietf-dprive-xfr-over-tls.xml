<abstract>
<t>DNS zone transfers are transmitted in clear text, which gives attackers the
opportunity to collect the content of a zone by eavesdropping on network
connections. The DNS Transaction Signature (TSIG) mechanism is specified to
restrict direct zone transfer to authorized clients only, but it does not add
confidentiality. This document specifies the use of TLS, rather than clear text, to
prevent zone content collection via passive monitoring of zone transfers:
XFR-over-TLS (XoT). Additionally, this specification updates RFC1995,
RFC5936 and RFC7766.

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>DNS has a number of privacy vulnerabilities, as discussed in detail in
<xref target="RFC7626"/>. Stub client to recursive resolver query privacy has received the
most attention to date, with standards track documents for both DNS-over-TLS
(DoT) <xref target="RFC7858"/> and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) <xref target="RFC8484"/>, and a proposal for
DNS-over-QUIC <xref target="I-D.ietf-dprive-dnsoquic"/>. There is ongoing work on DNS privacy
requirements for exchanges between recursive resolvers and authoritative
servers <xref target="I-D.ietf-dprive-phase2-requirements"/> and some suggestions for how
signaling of DoT support by authoritatives might work, e.g.,
<xref target="I-D.vandijk-dprive-ds-dot-signal-and-pin"/>. However there is currently no RFC
that specifically defines recursive to authoritative DNS-over-TLS (ADoT).
</t>
<t><xref target="RFC7626"/> established that stub client DNS query
transactions are not public and needed protection, but on zone transfer
<xref target="RFC1995"/> <xref target="RFC5936"/> it says only:
</t>

<figure align="center"><artwork align="center">
"Privacy risks for the holder of a zone (the risk that someone
gets the data) are discussed in [RFC5936] and [RFC5155]."
</artwork></figure>
<t>In what way is exposing the full contents of a zone a privacy risk? The
contents of the zone could include information such as names of persons used in
names of hosts. Best practice is not to use personal information for domain
names, but many such domain names exist. The contents of the zone could also
include references to locations that allow inference about location information
of the individuals associated with the zone's organization. It could also
include references to other organizations. Examples of this could be:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Person-laptop.example.org</t>
<t>MX-for-Location.example.org</t>
<t>Service-tenant-from-another-org.example.org</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>There may also be regulatory, policy or other reasons why the zone contents in
full must be treated as private.
</t>
<t>Neither of the RFCs mentioned in <xref target="RFC7626"/>
contemplates the risk that someone gets the data through eavesdropping on
network connections, only via enumeration or unauthorized transfer as described
in the following paragraphs.
</t>
<t>Zone enumeration is trivially possible for DNSSEC zones which use NSEC; i.e.
queries for the authenticated denial of existences records allow a client to
walk through the entire zone contents. <xref target="RFC5155"/> specifies NSEC3, a mechanism
to provide measures against zone enumeration for DNSSEC signed zones (a goal
was to make it as hard to enumerate an DNSSEC signed zone as an unsigned zone).
Whilst this is widely used, zone walking is now possible with NSEC3 due to
crypto-breaking advances. This has prompted further work on an alternative
mechanism for DNSSEC authenticated denial of existence - NSEC5
<xref target="I-D.vcelak-nsec5"/> - however questions remain over the practicality of this
mechanism.
</t>
<t><xref target="RFC5155"/> does not address data obtained outside zone enumeration (nor does
<xref target="I-D.vcelak-nsec5"/>). Preventing eavesdropping of zone transfers (this draft)
is orthogonal to preventing zone enumeration, though they aim to protect the
same information.
</t>
<t><xref target="RFC5936"/> specifies using TSIG <xref target="RFC8945"/> for authorization of the clients
of a zone transfer and for data integrity, but does not express any need for
confidentiality, and TSIG does not offer encryption. Some operators use SSH
tunneling or IPSec to encrypt the transfer data.
</t>
<t>Section 8 of the NIST guide on 'Secure Domain Name System (DNS) Deployment'
<xref target="nist-guide"/> discusses restricting access for zone transfers using ACLs and TSIG
in more detail. It is noted that in all the common open source implementations
such ACLs are applied on a per query basis. Since requests typically occur on
TCP connections authoritatives must cater for accepting any TCP connection and
then handling the authentication of each XFR request individually.
</t>
<t>Because both AXFR and IXFR zone transfers are typically carried out over TCP
from authoritative DNS protocol implementations, encrypting zone transfers
using TLS, based closely on DoT <xref target="RFC7858"/>, seems like a simple step forward.
This document specifies how to use TLS as a transport to prevent zone
collection from zone transfers.

<t>Performance. Existing AXFR and IXFR mechanisms have the burden of backwards
compatibility with older implementations based on the original specifications
in <xref target="RFC1034"/> and <xref target="RFC1035"/>. For example, some older AXFR servers donâ€™t
support using a TCP connection for multiple AXFR sessions or XFRs of different
zones because they have not been updated to follow the guidance in <xref target="RFC5936"/>.
Any implementation of XFR-over-TLS (XoT) would obviously be required to

<section anchor="threat-model" title="Threat model">
<t>The threat model considered here is one where the current contents and size of the zone are considered
sensitive and should be protected during transfer.
</t>
<t>The threat model does not, however, consider the existence of a zone, the act of
zone transfer between two entities, nor the identities of the nameservers
hosting a zone (including both those acting as hidden primaries/secondaries
or directly serving the zone) as sensitive information. The proposed mechanisms
does not attempt to obscure such information. The reasons for this include:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>much of this information can be obtained by various methods including active scanning of the DNS</t>
<t>an attacker who can monitor network traffic can relatively easily infer relations between
nameservers simply from traffic patterns, even when some or all of the traffic is encrypted</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>It is noted that simply using XoT will indicate a desire by the zone owner that the contents of the zone
remain confidential and so could be subject to blocking (e.g. via blocking of port 853) if an attacker had
such capabilities. However this threat is likely true of any such mechanism that attempts to encrypt data
passed between nameservers e.g. IPsec.

<t>The original specification for zone transfers in <xref target="RFC1034"/> and <xref target="RFC1035"/> was
based on a polling mechanism: a secondary performed a periodic SOA query (based
on the refresh timer) to determine if an AXFR was required.
</t>
<t><xref target="RFC1995"/> and <xref target="RFC1996"/> introduced the concepts of IXFR and NOTIFY
respectively, to provide for prompt propagation of zone updates. This has
largely replaced AXFR where possible, particularly for dynamically updated
zones.
</t>
<t><xref target="RFC5936"/> subsequently redefined the specification of AXFR to improve
performance and interoperability.
</t>
<t>In this document we use the term &quot;XFR mechanism&quot; to describe the entire set of
message exchanges between a secondary and a primary that concludes in a

<t>An AXFR is often (but not always) preceded by a NOTIFY (over UDP) from the

<t>If the primary serial is higher than the secondaries serial (using Serial

<t><xref target="RFC5936"/> re-specified AXFR providing additional guidance beyond that provided
in <xref target="RFC1034"/> and <xref target="RFC1035"/> and importantly specified that AXFR must use TCP

<t>Additionally, sections 4.1, 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 of <xref target="RFC5936"/> provide improved

constrained by having to be backwards compatible with some very early basic
implementations of AXFR. For example, it outlines that the SOA query can also
happen on this connection. However, this can cause interoperability problems
with older implementations that support only the trivial case of one AXFR per
connection.

<section anchor="updates-to-existing-specifications" title="Updates to existing specifications">
<t>For convenience, the term 'XFR-over-TCP' is used in this document to mean both
IXFR-over-TCP and AXFR-over-TCP and therefore statements that use that term update
both <xref target="RFC1995"/> and <xref target="RFC5936"/>, and implicitly also apply to XoT.
Differences in behavior specific to XoT are discussed in
<xref target="xot-specification"/>.
</t>
<t>Both <xref target="RFC1995"/> and <xref target="RFC5936"/> were published sometime before TCP was
considered a first class transport for DNS. <xref target="RFC1995"/>, in fact, says nothing
with respect to optimizing IXFRs over TCP or re-using already open TCP
connections to perform IXFRs or other queries. Therefore, there arguably is an
implicit assumption (probably unintentional) that a TCP connection is used for
one and only one IXFR request. Indeed, many major open source implementations
currently take this approach. And whilst <xref target="RFC5936"/> gives guidance on
connection re-use for AXFR, it pre-dates more recent specifications describing
persistent TCP connections e.g. <xref target="RFC7766"/>, <xref target="RFC7828"/> and AXFR implementations again
often make less than optimal use of open connections.
</t>
<t>Given this, new implementations of XoT will clearly benefit from specific guidance on
TCP/TLS connection usage for XFR because this will:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>result in more consistent XoT implementations with better interoperability</t>
<t>remove any need for XoT implementations to support legacy behavior that
XFR-over-TCP implementations have historically often supported</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>Therefore this document updates both the previous specifications for
XFR-over-TCP to clarify that
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Implementations MUST use <xref target="RFC7766"/> (DNS Transport over TCP - Implementation
Requirements) to optimize the use of TCP connections.</t>
<t>Whilst RFC7766 states that 'DNS clients SHOULD pipeline their queriesâ€™ on TCP
connections, it did not distinguish between XFRs and other queries for this
behavior. It is now recognized that XFRs are not as latency sensitive as
other queries, and can be significantly more complex for clients to handle
both because of the large amount of state that must be kept and because there
may be multiple messages in the responses. For these reasons it is clarified
here that a valid reason for not pipelining queries is when they are all XFR
queries i.e. clients sending multiple XFRs MAY choose not to pipeline those
queries. Clients that do not pipeline XFR queries, therefore, have no
additional requirements to handle out-of-order or intermingled responses (as
described later) since they will never receive them.</t>
<t>Implementations SHOULD use <xref target="RFC7828"/> (The edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option)
to manage persistent connections.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>The following sections include detailed clarifications on the updates to XFR
behavior implied in <xref target="RFC7766"/> and how the use of <xref target="RFC7828"/> applies
specifically to XFR exchanges. It also discusses how IXFR and AXFR can reuse
the same TCP connection.
</t>
<t>For completeness, we also mention here the recent specification of extended DNS
error (EDE) codes <xref target="RFC8914"/>. For zone transfers, when returning REFUSED to a
zone transfer request to an 'unauthorized' client (e.g. where the client is not
listed in an ACL for zone transfers or does not sign the request with the
correct TSIG key), the extended DNS error code 18 (Prohibited) can also be sent.

<t>We clarify here that if an OPT record is present in a received AXFR request,
compliant responders MUST include an OPT record in each of the subsequent AXFR

edns-tcp-keepalive, enables AXFR servers to signal the desire to close a
connection (when existing transactions have competed) due to low resources by
sending an edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 option with a timeout of 0 on any AXFR
response. This does not signal that the AXFR is aborted, just that the server
wishes to close the connection as soon as possible.

recommendations with regard to TCP/TLS connection handling:
</t>

<figure align="center"><artwork align="center">
"To mitigate the risk of unintentional server overload, DNS
clients MUST take care to minimize the number of concurrent TCP
connections made to any individual server. It is RECOMMENDED
that for any given client/server interaction there SHOULD be no
more than one connection for regular queries, one for zone
transfers, and one for each protocol that is being used on top
of TCP (for example, if the resolver was using TLS). However,
it is noted that certain primary/ secondary configurations with
many busy zones might need to use more than one TCP connection
for zone transfers for operational reasons (for example, to
support concurrent transfers of multiple zones)."
</artwork></figure>
<t>Whilst this recommends a particular behavior for the clients using TCP, it
does not relax the requirement for servers to handle 'mixed' traffic (regular
queries and zone transfers) on any open TCP/TLS connection. It also overlooks the
potential that other transports might want to take the same approach with regard to
using separate connections for different purposes.
</t>
<t>This specification for XoT updates the guidance in <xref target="RFC7766"/> to provide the
same separation of connection purpose (regular queries and zone transfers) for
all transports being used on top of TCP.
</t>
<t>Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that for
each protocol used on top of TCP in any given client/server interaction there
SHOULD be no more than one connection for regular queries and one for zone
transfers.
</t>

UDP or TCP, or TLS.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="xot-vs-adot" title="XoT vs ADoT">
<t>As noted earlier, there is currently no specification for encryption of
connections from recursive resolvers to authoritative servers. Some
authoritatives are experimenting with ADoT and opportunistic encryption has
also been raised as a possibility; it is therefore highly likely that use of
encryption by authoritative servers will evolve in the coming years.
</t>
<t>This raises questions in the short term,Â§Â§ with regard to TLS connection and
message handling for authoritative servers. In particular, there is likely to be
a class of authoritatives that wish to use XoT in the near future with a small
number of configured secondaries but that do wish to support DoT for regular
queries from recursive in that same time frame. These servers have to
potentially cope with probing and direct queries from recursives and from test
servers, and also potential attacks that might wish to make use of TLS to
overload the server.
</t>
<t><xref target="RFC5936"/> clearly states that non-AXFR session traffic can use an open TCP
connection, however, this requirement needs to be re-evaluated when considering
applying the same model to XoT. Proposing that a server should also start
responding to all queries received over TLS just because it has enabled XoT
would be equivalent to defining a form of authoritative DoT. This specification
does not propose that, but it also does not prohibit servers from answering
queries unrelated to XFR exchanges over TLS. Rather, this specification
simply outlines in later sections:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>how XoT implementations should utilize EDE codes in response to queries on TLS
connections they are not willing to answer (see <xref target="response-rcodes"/>)</t>
<t>the operational and policy options that a XoT server operator has
with regard to managing TLS connections and messages (see <xref target="xot-server-connection-handling"/>)</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="response-rcodes" title="Response RCODES">
<t>XoT clients and servers MUST implement EDE codes. If a XoT server receives
non-XoT traffic it is not willing to answer on a TLS connection it SHOULD
respond with the extended DNS error code 21 - Not Supported
<xref target="RFC8914"/>. XoT clients should not send any further
queries of this type to the server for a reasonable period of time (for
example, one hour) i.e., long enough that the server configuration or policy
might be updated.
</t>
<t>Historically servers have used the REFUSED RCODE for many situations, and so
clients often had no detailed information on which to base an error or fallback
path when queries were refused. As a result the client behavior could vary
significantly. XoT servers that refuse queries must cater for the fact that
client behavior might vary from continually retrying queries regardless of
receiving REFUSED to every query, or at the other extreme clients may decide to
stop using the server over any transport. This might be because those clients are
either non-XoT clients or do not implement EDE codes.

<section anchor="padding-axot-responses" title="Padding AXoT responses">
<t>The goal of padding AXoT responses would be two fold:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>to obfuscate the actual size of the transferred zone to minimize information
leakage about the entire contents of the zone.</t>
<t>to obfuscate the incremental changes to the zone between SOA updates to
minimize information leakage about zone update activity and growth.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>Note that the re-use of XoT connections for transfers of multiple different
zones complicates any attempt to analyze the traffic size and timing to
extract information.
</t>
<t>It is noted here that, depending on the padding policies eventually developed for XoT,
the requirement to obfuscate the total zone size might
require a server to create 'empty' AXoT responses. That is, AXoT responses that
contain no RR's apart from an OPT RR containing the EDNS(0) option for padding.
For example, without this capability the maximum size that a tiny zone could be padded to would
theoretically be limited if there had to be a minimum of 1 RR per packet.
</t>
<t>However, as with existing AXFR, the last AXoT response message sent MUST
contain the same SOA that was in the first message of the AXoT response series
in order to signal the conclusion of the zone transfer.
</t>
<t><xref target="RFC5936"/> says:
</t>

<figure align="center"><artwork align="center">
"Each AXFR response message SHOULD contain a sufficient number
of RRs to reasonably amortize the per-message overhead, up to
the largest number that will fit within a DNS message (taking
the required content of the other sections into account, as
described below)."
</artwork></figure>
<t>'Empty' AXoT responses generated in order to meet a padding requirement will be
exceptions to the above statement. For flexibility, future proofing and in
order to guarantee support for future padding policies, we state here that
secondary implementations MUST be resilient to receiving padded AXoT responses,
including 'empty' AXoT responses that contain only an OPT RR containing the
EDNS(0) option for padding.
</t>
<t>Recommendation of specific policies for padding AXoT responses are out of scope
for this specification. Detailed considerations of such policies and the
trade-offs involved are expected to be the subject of future work.

<section anchor="condensation-of-responses" title="Condensation of responses">
<t><xref target="RFC1995"/> says condensation of responses is optional and MAY be done. Whilst
it does add complexity to generating responses it can significantly reduce the
size of responses. However any such reduction might be offset by increased
message size due to padding. This specification does not update the optionality
of condensation for XoT responses.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="fallback-to-axfr" title="Fallback to AXFR">
<t>Fallback to AXFR can happen, for example, if the server is not able to provide
an IXFR for the requested SOA. Implementations differ in how long they store
zone deltas and how many may be stored at any one time.
</t>
<t>Just as with IXFR-over-TCP, after a failed IXFR a IXoT client SHOULD request
the AXFR on the already open XoT connection.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="padding-of-ixot-responses" title="Padding of IXoT responses">
<t>The goal of padding IXoT responses would be to obfuscate the incremental
changes to the zone between SOA updates to minimize information leakage about

reveal information.
</t>
<t>IXFR responses can vary in size greatly from the order of 100 bytes for one or
two record updates, to tens of thousands of bytes for large dynamic DNSSEC
signed zones. The frequency of IXFR responses can also depend greatly on if and
how the zone is DNSSEC signed.

</section>

<section anchor="name-compression-and-maximum-payload-sizes" title="Name compression and maximum payload sizes">
<t>It is noted here that name compression <xref target="RFC1035"/> can be used in XFR responses
to reduce the size of the payload, however the maximum value of the offset that
can be used in the name compression pointer structure is 16384. For some DNS
implementations this limits the size of an individual XFR response used in
practice to something around the order of 16kB. In principle, larger
payload sizes can be supported for some responses with more sophisticated
approaches (e.g. by pre-calculating the maximum offset required).
</t>
<t>Implementations may wish to offer options to disable name compression for XoT
responses to enable larger payloads. This might be particularly helpful when
padding is used since minimizing the payload size is not necessarily a useful
optimization in this case and disabling name compression will reduce the
resources required to construct the payload.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="multiprimary-configurations" title="Multi-primary Configurations">
<t>Also known as multi-master configurations this model can provide flexibility
and redundancy particularly for IXFR. A secondary will receive one or more
NOTIFY messages and can send an SOA to all of the configured primaries. It can
then choose to send an XFR request to the primary with the highest SOA (or
other criteria, e.g., RTT).
</t>
<t>When using persistent connections the secondary may have a XoT connection
already open to one or more primaries. Should a secondary preferentially
request an XFR from a primary to which it already has an open XoT connection
or the one with the highest SOA (assuming it doesn't have a connection open to
it already)?
</t>
<t>Two extremes can be envisaged here. The first one can be considered a 'preferred
primary connection' model. In this case the secondary continues to use one
persistent connection to a single primary until it has reason not to. Reasons
not to might include the primary repeatedly closing the connection, long RTTs on
transfers or the SOA of the primary being an unacceptable lag behind the SOA of
an alternative primary.
</t>
<t>The other extreme can be considered a 'parallel primary connection' model. Here
a secondary could keep multiple persistent connections open to all available
primaries and only request XFRs from the primary with the highest serial number.
Since normally the number of secondaries and primaries in direct contact in a
transfer group is reasonably low this might be feasible if latency is the most
significant concern.
</t>
<t>Recommendation of a particular scheme is out of scope of this document but
implementations are encouraged to provide configuration options that allow
operators to make choices about this behavior.

<section anchor="authentication-mechanisms" title="Authentication mechanisms">
<t>To provide context to the requirements in section <xref target="xot-transfers"/>, this

available when performing zone transfers.
<xref target="xot-authentication"/> then discusses in more details specifically how a

<t>We classify the mechanisms based on the following properties:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>'Data Origin Authentication' (DO): Authentication that the DNS message originated
from the party with whom credentials were shared, and of the data integrity
of the message contents (the originating party may or may not be party
operating the far end of a TCP/TLS connection in a 'proxy' scenario).</t>
<t>'Channel Confidentiality' (CC): Confidentiality of the communication channel between the
client and server (i.e. the two end points of a TCP/TLS connection) from passive surveillance.</t>
<t>'Channel Authentication' (CA): Authentication of the identity of party to whom a TCP/TLS
connection is made (this might not be a direct connection between the primary
and secondary in a proxy scenario).</t>
</list>
</t>

<section anchor="tsig" title="TSIG">
<t>TSIG <xref target="RFC8945"/> provides a mechanism for two or more parties to use shared
secret keys which can then be used to create a message digest to protect
individual DNS messages. This allows each party to authenticate that a request

transmitted over an unsecured channel or via a proxy.

<section anchor="opportunistic-tls" title="Opportunistic TLS">
<t>Opportunistic TLS for DoT is defined in <xref target="RFC8310"/> and can provide a defense against passive
surveillance, providing on-the-wire confidentiality. Essentially
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>clients that know authentication information for a server SHOULD try to authenticate the server</t>
<t>however they MAY fallback to using TLS without authentication and</t>
<t>they MAY fallback to using cleartext if TLS is not available.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>As such it does not offer a defense against active attacks (e.g. a MitM attack
on the connection from client to server), and is not considered as useful for XoT.
</t>
<t>Properties: None guaranteed.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="strict-tls" title="Strict TLS">
<t>Strict TLS for DoT <xref target="RFC8310"/> requires that a client is configured with an
authentication domain name (and/or SPKI pinset) that MUST be used to
authenticate the TLS handshake with the server. If authentication of the server
fails, the client will not proceed with the connection. This provides a defense
for the client against active surveillance, providing client-to-server
authentication and end-to-end channel confidentiality.
</t>
<t>Properties: Channel confidentiality and authentication (of the server).
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="mutual-tls" title="Mutual TLS">
<t>This is an extension to Strict TLS <xref target="RFC8310"/> which requires that a client is
configured with an authentication domain name (and/or SPKI pinset) and a client
certificate. The client offers the certificate for authentication by the server
and the client can authentic the server the same way as in Strict TLS. This
provides a defense for both parties against active surveillance, providing
bi-directional authentication and end-to-end channel confidentiality.
</t>
<t>Properties: Channel confidentiality and mutual authentication.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="ip-based-acl-on-the-primary" title="IP Based ACL on the Primary">
<t>Most DNS server implementations offer an option to configure an IP based Access
Control List (ACL), which is often used in combination with TSIG based ACLs to
restrict access to zone transfers on primary servers on a per query basis.
</t>
<t>This is also possible with XoT but it must be noted that, as with TCP, the
implementation of such an ACL cannot be enforced on the primary until an XFR
request is received on an established connection.
</t>
<t>As discussed in <xref target="xot-server-connection-handling"/> an IP based per connection ACL
could also be implemented where only TLS connections from recognized
secondaries are accepted.
</t>
<t>Properties: Channel authentication of the client.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="zonemd" title="ZONEMD">
<t>For completeness, we also describe Message Digest for DNS Zones (ZONEMD)
<xref target="RFC8976"/> here. The message digest
is a mechanism that can be used to verify the content of a standalone zone. It
is designed to be independent of the transmission channel or mechanism, allowing
a general consumer of a zone to do origin authentication of the entire zone
contents. Note that the current version of <xref target="RFC8976"/>
states:
</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">As specified herein, ZONEMD is impractical for large, dynamic zones due to the
time and resources required for digest calculation. However, The ZONEMD record
is extensible so that new digest schemes may be added in the future to support
large, dynamic zones.</spanx>
</t>
<t>It is complementary but orthogonal the above mechanisms; and can be used in
conjunction with XoT but is not considered further here.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="xot-authentication" title="XoT authentication">
<t>It is noted that zone transfer scenarios can vary from a simple single
primary/secondary relationship where both servers are under the control of a
single operator to a complex hierarchical structure which includes proxies and
multiple operators. Each deployment scenario will require specific analysis to
determine which combination of authentication methods are best suited to the
deployment model in question.
</t>
<t>The XoT authentication requirement specified in <xref target="xot-transfers"/> addresses the
issue of ensuring that the transfers is encrypted between the two endpoints
directly involved in the current transfers. The following table summarized the
properties of a selection of the mechanisms discussed in
<xref target="authentication-mechanisms"/>. The two letter acronyms for the properties are
used below and (S) indicates the secondary and (P) indicates
the primary.

<t>Based on this analysis it can be seen that:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Using just mutual TLS can be considered a standalone solution since both end points are authenticated</t>
<t>Using Strict TLS and an IP based ACL on the primary also provides authentication of both end points</t>
<t>Additional use of TSIG (or equally SIG(0)) can also provide data origin
authentication which might be desirable for deployments that include a proxy
between the secondary and primary, but is not part of the XoT requirement
because it does nothing to guarantee channel confidentiality or
authentication.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="policies-for-both-axot-and-ixot" title="Policies for Both AXoT and IXoT">
<t>Whilst the protection of the zone contents in a transfer between two end points
can be provided by the XoT protocol, the protection of all the transfers of a
given zone requires operational administration and policy management.
</t>
<t>We call the entire group of servers involved in XFR for a particular set of
zones (all the primaries and all the secondaries) the 'transfer group'.
</t>
<t>Within any transfer group both AXFRs and IXFRs for a zone MUST all use the
same policy, e.g., if AXFRs use AXoT all IXFRs MUST use IXoT.
</t>
<t>In order to assure the confidentiality of the zone information, the entire
transfer group MUST have a consistent policy of requiring confidentiality. If
any do not, this is a weak link for attackers to exploit.
</t>
<t>An individual zone transfer is not considered protected by XoT unless
both the client and server are configured to use only XoT and the overall zone
transfer is not considered protected until all members of the transfer group
are configured to use only XoT with all other transfers servers (see <xref target="implementation-considerations"/>).
</t>
<t>A XoT policy should specify
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>What kind of TLS is required (Strict or Mutual TLS)</t>
<t>or if an IP based ACL is required.</t>
<t>(optionally) if TSIG/SIG(0) is required</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>Since this may require configuration of a number of servers who may be under
the control of different operators the desired consistency could be hard to
enforce and audit in practice.
</t>
<t>Certain aspects of the Policies can be relatively easily tested independently,
e.g., by requesting zone transfers without TSIG, from unauthorized IP addresses
or over cleartext DNS. Other aspects such as if a secondary will accept data
without a TSIG digest or if secondaries are using Strict as opposed to
Opportunistic TLS are more challenging.
</t>
<t>The mechanics of co-ordinating or enforcing such policies are out of the scope
of this document but may be the subject of future operational guidance.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="implementation-considerations" title="Implementation Considerations">
<t>Server implementations may want to also offer options that allow ACLs on a zone
to specify that a specific client can use either XoT or TCP. This would allow
for flexibility while clients are migrating to XoT.
</t>
<t>Client implementations may similarly want to offer options to cater for the
multi-primary case where the primaries are migrating to XoT.
</t>
<t>Such configuration options MUST only be used in a 'migration mode' though, and
therefore should be used with care.
</t>
<t>It is noted that use of a TLS proxy in front of the primary server is a simple
deployment solution that can enable server side XoT.

<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">
<t>This document specifies a security measure against a DNS risk: the risk that an
attacker collects entire DNS zones through eavesdropping on clear text DNS zone
transfers.

</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>the risk that some level of zone activity might be inferred by observing zone
transfer sizes and timing on encrypted connections (even with padding

observation of encrypted connections.</t>

<section anchor="xot-server-connection-handling" title="XoT server connection handling">
<t>For completeness, it is noted that an earlier version of the specification
suggested using a XoT specific ALPN to negotiate TLS connections that supported
only a limited set of queries (SOA, XRFs) however this did not gain support.
Reasons given included additional code complexity and proxies having no natural
way to forward the ALPN signal to DNS nameservers over TCP connections.
</t>

<section anchor="only-listen-on-tls-on-a-specific-ip-address" title="Only listen on TLS on a specific IP address">
<t>Obviously a nameserver which hosts a zone and services queries for the zone on
an IP address published in an NS record may wish to use a separate IP address
for listening on TLS for XoT, only publishing that address to its secondaries.
</t>
<t>Pros: Probing of the public IP address will show no support for TLS. ACLs will
prevent zone transfer on all transports on a per query basis.
</t>
<t>Cons: Attackers passively observing traffic will still be able to observe TLS
connections to the separate address.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="client-specific-tls-acceptance" title="Client specific TLS acceptance">
<t>Primaries that include IP based ACLs and/or mutual TLS in their authentication models
have the option of only accepting TLS connections from authorized clients. This
could be implemented using a proxy or directly in DNS implementation.
</t>
<t>Pros: Connection management happens at setup time. The maximum number of TLS
connections a server will have to support can be easily assessed. Once the
connection is accepted the server might well be willing to answer any query on
that connection since it is coming from a configured secondary and a specific
response policy on the connection may not be needed (see below).
</t>
<t>Cons: Currently, none of the major open source DNS authoritative
implementations support such an option.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="sni-based-tls-acceptance" title="SNI based TLS acceptance">
<t>Primaries could also choose to only accept TLS connections based on an SNI that
was published only to their secondaries.
</t>
<t>Pros: Reduces the number of accepted connections.
</t>
<t>Cons: As above. For SNIs sent in the clear, this would still allow attackers
passively observing traffic to potentially abuse this mechanism. The use of
Encrypted Client Hello <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-esni"/> may be of use here.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="tls-specific-response-policies" title="TLS specific response policies">
<t>Some primaries might rely on TSIG/SIG(0) combined with per-query IP based
ACLs to authenticate secondaries. In this case the primary must accept all
incoming TLS connections and then apply a TLS specific response policy on a per
query basis.
</t>
<t>As an aside, whilst <xref target="RFC7766"/> makes a general purpose distinction to clients
in the usage of connections (between regular queries and zone transfers) this is
not strict and nothing in the DNS protocol prevents using the same connection
for both types of traffic. Hence a server cannot know the intention of any
client that connects to it, it can only inspect the messages it receives on
such a connection and make per query decisions about whether or not to answer
those queries.
</t>
<t>Example policies a XoT server might implement are:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>strict: REFUSE all queries on TLS connections except SOA and authorized XFR requests</t>
<t>moderate: REFUSE all queries on TLS connections until one is received that is
signed by a recognized TSIG/SIG(0) key, then answer all queries on the
connection after that</t>
<t>complex: apply a heuristic to determine which queries on a TLS connections to REFUSE</t>
<t>relaxed: answer all non-XoT queries on all TLS connections with the same policy applied to TCP queries</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>Pros: Allows for flexible behavior by the server that could be changed over time.
</t>
<t>Cons: The server must handle the burden of accepting all TLS connections just
to perform XFRs with a small number of secondaries. Client behavior to REFUSED
response is not clearly defined (see below). Currently, none of the major open
source DNS authoritative implementations offer an option for different response
policies in different transports (but could potentially be implemented using a proxy).
</t>

<section anchor="sni-based-response-policies" title="SNI based response policies">
<t>In a similar fashion, XoT servers might use the presence of an SNI in the
client hello to determine which response policy to initially apply to the TLS
connections.
</t>
<t>Pros: This has to potential to allow a clean distinction between a XoT service
and any future DoT based service for answering recursive queries.
</t>
<t>Cons: As above.
